The variables of note included in this dataset are species, island of
origin, bill and flipper length, bill depth, body mass, and sex. The
dataset is 344 rows long and 8 variables wide. The mean flipper length
is 200.9152047 mm. The maximum bill length is NA and the minimum is NA.
The maximum body mass is NA and the mean body mass is NA.

``` r
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) + geom_point()

# Problem 2

This sample data data frame is comprised of:

a random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution a logical
vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 0 a
character vector of length 10 a factor vector of length 10, with 3
different factor “levels” (“high”, “med”, “low”)

``` r
problem2_df = tibble(
  var_norm = rnorm(10),
  var_logical = var_norm > 0,
  var_character = c("12 feet", "5 feet", "3 feet", "4 feet", "11 feet", "8 feet", "7 feet", "2 feet", "9 feet", "15 feet"),
  var_factor = factor(c("high", "med", "low", "low", "high", "med", "med", "low", "high", "high"))
)
```

Attempt to take the mean of each variable in the dataset.

``` r
mean(problem2_df$var_norm)
```

    ## [1] -0.02815248

``` r
mean(problem2_df$var_logical)
```

    ## [1] 0.5

``` r
# mean(problem2_df$var_factor)
# mean(problem2_df$var_character) 
```

We cannot take the mean of `var_character` because “Argument is not
numeric or logical: returning NA.” This makes sense because the
character variables are coded as characters and contain both numbers and
letters, it would logically be impossible to take the mean of letters.
The same thing happens with the factor variable.

Although the logical variable appears to also be words, R is still able
to take the mean without error. This is because the only two options for
logical vectors (TRUE and FALSE) are coded as 1 and 0, respectively. In
this case, R added up the sum of those 0s and 1s, and divided by the
total (10). There were 8 TRUES, so the mean computed with this function
is 0.8.

    Converting variables from one type to another...

``` r
as.numeric(problem2_df$var_logical)
as.numeric(problem2_df$var_character)
```

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

``` r
as.numeric(problem2_df$var_factor)
```

When the logical variable is changed to a numeric, the TRUE and FALSE
show up as 0 and 1, as described above. This explains numerically why
the mean of this variable was 0.8. When the character variable is
changed to a numeric, R does not know what to do with the combination or
text, and codes each entry as NA, which is impossible to take the mean
of. When the factor variable is changed to a numeric, R assigns a number
to each factor “level.” Since in this case there were 3 levels (high,
med, low) each entry got either a 1, 2, or 3. This would now make it
theoretically possible to take a mean, but the output would not be very
meaningful.
